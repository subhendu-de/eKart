##### How to Run the arm template scripts locally

```ps
New-AzSubscriptionDeployment `
  -Name eKartDeployment `
  -Location centralindia `
  -TemplateFile azuredeploy.json
```
<sup>Please check the baseURI in the azuredeploy.json before running the arm template scripts</sup>

**Please read the steps below** if you want to make additional changes and run the arm template scripts from your local machine to validate. 

Linked templates are used to deploy the artifacts. They should be accessed publicly either by hosting it on the public Git repository or on a storage account. There is a shortcut to test the linked templates locally. Please follow the steps below

 - Install Node.js
 - Install http-server and NPM package

 - Go to the scripts folder
 - Type http-server and hit enter
 - Open another command prompt
 - Type cd D:\ngrok and hit enter
 - Type ngork.exe http 8080 and hit enter to serve the files externally
 - Open the azuredeploy.json file and change the baseURI variable
